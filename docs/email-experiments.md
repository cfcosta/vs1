# Email classifier experiments

Experiments use local Maildir copies and dry-run inference only, with the
`typed-decisions` checkpoint, CUDA BF16, flash attention, and batch size 16.
Descriptions, chunking and pooling stay fixed except for the factor under test.
The development sample has 100 messages and 61 existing labels; a separate
100-message validation sample has 45 labels frozen before viewing predictions.
Three exact-body duplicates were excluded from the initially labeled 48
validation entries before comparing any experiment there. These selected
clear-case subsets do not estimate whole-mailbox accuracy.

Each variant runs twice after model warmup. Timings exclude model loading.
Only improvements on both labeled subsets qualify for adoption; changes that
fail the development comparison are reverted without tuning on validation.
Raw private messages and diagnostics stay outside the repository.

Baseline: 35/61 development, 25/45 validation. Development runtime is 9.71s
(mean of the preceding two identical-baseline runs); validation runtime 14.46s.

## 1. Keep two candidates from each preliminary group

For 17 categories, preserve two of each group's candidates, then run two
four-way contests and one final two-way contest: seven questions per chunk.
Stable ties and finalist order follow configuration order. A failing mock test
first established that a runner-up could not reach the final; the implementation
then passed that test and the existing small-choice tests.

Both passes regressed to 29/61; mean runtime 14.43s versus 9.71s.
Two errors were corrected and eight previously correct labels regressed.
Implementation and experimental tests were reverted. No improvement commit
was made. Validation was not used to tune this failed candidate.

## 2. Category-order sensitivity

Two permutations fixed before viewing predictions: reverse configuration order,
and a shuffle with seed 20260921. They change group membership/option order
without changing category definitions. This is a sensitivity check, not a search
for the best ordering.

Reverse order: 34/61, mean 10.75s, 27/100 predictions changed.
Seeded shuffle: 33/61, mean 10.72s, 29/100 predictions changed.
Both repetitions agreed. Neither ordering is retained. This exposes
group/option-order sensitivity but does not justify selecting an order.

## 3. Purpose distinctions in descriptions

One predeclared revision emphasizes paid versus unpaid, recruiting versus
client work, and developer broadcasts versus operational notifications. No
owner data or category names change.

Development: 36/61 on both passes, mean 10.86s; four fixes and three
regressions. Validation: 30/45 on both passes versus baseline 25/45, mean 14.60s
versus 14.46s. The revised descriptions are retained. This is a measured
gain on two small selected subsets, not evidence of reliable automatic filing.

## 4. Recognizable boilerplate removal

Target payment-provider support/anti-phishing footers and calendar dial-in
blocks. Preserve transaction fields, meeting purpose, and quoted history.

Both passes scored 35/61, unchanged from baseline. Chunks fell from 144 to
141 (705 questions versus 720), but mean runtime was 10.58s: no convincing
runtime improvement against the 9.71s earlier baseline or 10.7s contemporary
order controls. Implementation and tests for this experiment were reverted. Existing
tracking-link removal and mislabeled-HTML rendering remain intact.

## Final disposition

| Experiment                       | Development correct / 61 | Validation correct / 45 | Decision           |
| -------------------------------- | -----------------------: | ----------------------: | ------------------ |
| Baseline                         |                       35 |                      25 | Reference          |
| Top two per preliminary group    |                       29 |           Not evaluated | Reverted           |
| Reverse category order           |                       34 |           Not evaluated | Rejected           |
| Seeded shuffled category order   |                       33 |           Not evaluated | Rejected           |
| Purpose-specific descriptions    |                       36 |                      30 | Kept and committed |
| Recognizable boilerplate removal |                       35 |           Not evaluated | Reverted           |

Every completed condition repeated identical predictions. All runs classified
100 messages without processing failures. Rejected implementation changes and
the temporary runner were removed from the repository. Formatting, workspace
tests, and Clippy passed. The sole adopted change is the description revision;
tournament structure, category order, and chunk pooling remain unchanged.

Private reproducibility artifacts (frozen configurations, labels, per-chunk
results, timing records, runner source, and rejected patches) are stored in
`~/.local/state/vs1-email/four-experiments-20260921/`.
